      description: "Sri Lanka's tea story dates back to the 19th century, when British planter James Taylor introduced tea cultivation in 1867 in Kandy. What began as a small experiment soon transformed the island into one of the world's leading tea exporters, giving birth to the world-renowned 'Ceylon Tea.' Today, the rolling green plantations remain an iconic part of the central highlands. A visit to a tea plantation and factory lets you walk through these scenic landscapes, learn the art of tea plucking, and explore the fascinating process of tea production—from withering and rolling to drying and grading.",
